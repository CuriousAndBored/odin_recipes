    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There's something about a hearty breakfast of steak and eggs! It's delicious, satisfying, and filling.</p>
    <p>It's a breakfast that keeps me full for hours and enables me to sail right through to lunchtime - no midmorning snack needed.</p>
    <ul><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <li>1 Chuck eye steak</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Avocado oil spray</li>
        <li>Large Eggs</li>
        <li>Garnish (Seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>Cook the steak. Start by seasoning the steak and grilling it. Generally speaking, you should grill it for about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare, or a total of 3 minutes in a dual-contact grill. If you're using a New York strip, as I do in the video below, you should also briefly cook the fat strip.</li>
        <li>Fry the eggs. While the meat is resting, quickly fry the eggs in butter or avocado oil. I like to use round molds to make round eggs, as shown in the photo below, but this is not mandatory.</li>
        <li>Season and serve. Season the dish with salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and parsley, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
